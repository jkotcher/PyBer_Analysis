# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to look at the different city types to determine differences in ride-sharing data.  As part of this analysis we looked at fares by city type for each week and also a summary of fares by city type and average fare per ride and driver.


# Results

## Summary DataFrame
One of the largest disparities between the different city tyoes is the total number of rides.  As seen in the table below there are well over a thousand rides within urban cities whereas rural cities there have been just over a hundred rides.  In that same fashion from urban to rural the other summary columns also decrease.  The two average columns in the summary do not dcrease as you go from urban to rural they actually increase.

## Multi-line Chart
Each weekly fare in this line chart is a peak or a dip and the biggest disparity in this line chart is the fact rural fares on a weekly basis for this particular time frame were not very high.  By contrast the urban and suburban fares were much higher on a weekly basis.

# Summary

## Business recommendations
1. Inorder to make the number of drivers more even there should equal number of drivers in urban, rural and suburban cities.
2. Take the average fare of all three cities and charge that as a far across all city types.
3. For people traveling from urban to rural cities charge an up fee for traveling an extra long distance.
